      <h2>HTML/CSS Portfolio</h2>
      <p>This task was to create a portfolio to showcase what I have learnt over the HTML and CSS module of
        SheCodes Plus. 
        This website features information on myself and a place to hold a summary of each project 
        I complete.  It showcases implementation of website design and responsive design principles.

        <h2>Python Weather Project</h2>
        <p>This project was designed to manipulate raw data using python, including data cleaning, and creating formatted outputs.  The aim
            of this task was to pass a series of tests.</p>
        <p> As an extension task during this project I added an extra function to create some DRY code, and wrote a set of tests to test the new function.
            All tests were then automated in github to ensure any updates to the repository will re-test the code.

        <h2>Crowd Funding Web Application SPPOORRT</h2>
        <p>This project was broken into two parts - a Django backend and a React Front end.  The backend was deployed in Heroku and the front end in Netlify.</p>
        <p>My crowdfunding application is aimed at sporting clubs who want to fundraise for events, equipment, coaches or facilities. Users can add their club, and once
            they have a club added, they can add crowdfunding projects for their club.

        <h2>postITivity - A Group Project </h2>
        <p>This was a group project to produce an MVP app for a Client in a 4 week window. During this exercise we learnt to develop collaboratively and use git repositories to
            share and update code bases.  My focus was ERD design and backend development in Django, with some time spent setting up api links in the React front end and
            enhancing search functionality.</p>
